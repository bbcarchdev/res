  			<h1>
  				Welcome to the Research and Education Space (RES) – an initiative to improve access to public archives for use in education.
  			</h1>
  			<p>
  				Since 2013, the RES project has been working with teachers, students and academics, along with curators of world class digital collections and product developers to improve the resources and tools available in all levels of education. The project was a partnership initiative between the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a>, <a href="http://bufvc.ac.uk/">Learning on Screen</a> and <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Jisc</a>. 
  			</p>
        <p>
          This 4-year project phase has now come to an end, however the BBC will continue to work with public partners to develop RES as an open platform for publishing linked open data and explore the benefits of developing education propositions powered by RES with 3rd parties.  
        </p>
        <p>
          RES provides an open platform built by the BBC. The platform indexes and organises the digital <a href="/res/collections">collections</a> of libraries, museums, broadcasters and galleries to make their content more discoverable, accessible and usable to those in UK education and research. Images, TV and radio programmes, documents and text from world class organisations such as <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/">The British Museum</a>, <a href="http://www.bl.uk/">British Library</a>, <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/">The National Archives</a>, <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/">Europeana</a>, <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a> and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a> are all being indexed by RES. RES also enables <a href="/res/products">developers</a> to create digital educational products that will inspire learners, teachers and researchers by using applications powered by the RES platform.
